/**
 * A reference to a tag, topic, user, message group or thread. References are lightweight representations of the
 * underlying object. This allows you to display key data about objects referenced in messages without doing
 * additional polls. Each reference type maps to a subclass of {@link YammerReference}, which provides additional
 * information beyond the common properties specified by this class. Unknown references will be mapped to the parent
 * class {@link YammerReference}. 
 * 
 * From the Yammer API documentation:
 * References are used when one object refers to another, and data about the
 * referenced object would be useful. This avoids redundancy in what is
 * returned. For example, a page of messages may include 20 messages from the
 * same user. Each message will indicate that it was sent by a user and that
 * user's ID, and the references section will include that user only once and
 * include the name and mugshot (profile picture) URL.
